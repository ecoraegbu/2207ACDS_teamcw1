## Train data
-- We have pushed the main work file to GitHub
-- We are going to assess & analyse the train data set
to look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem.
-- check column names
-- checking dtypes
-- checking null values
-- drop unnamed column
-- time column should be datetime
-- 
-- barcelona and valencia pressure are not categorical
