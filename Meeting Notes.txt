Work to be completed
-- Data Cleaning
-- EDA
Assessed the duplicates 
Examining duplicates in the all the columns and outliers in the train data
All the rain_1h columns in the train data do not have percentiles
wind speed for valencia is an outlier
We noted that wind degree column for bilbao and valencia are not categorical
	- we will convert them to categorical by creating categories
Assessing the rain_1h in all cities for the train data
Some records(3) in barcelona are outliers of 12.0000

Examining duplicates in the all the columns and outliers in the test data
All the rain_1h columns in the test data do not have percentiles
bilbao rain_1h is highly skewed
The pressure columns are not categorical
fill null values with the mean on the pressure columns
clean barcelona pressure from exponent to float
